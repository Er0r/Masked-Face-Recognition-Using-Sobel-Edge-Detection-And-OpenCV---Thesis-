SOBEL ALGORITHM

After the breakout of the worldwide pandemic Covid-19, there arises a severe need of protection mechanisms. This recognizer proposes to recognize face with face masks by training machine with datasets, detecting face using Sobel edge detection and recognizing face using Haarcascade.

We have trained the recognizer with a good number of test datasets where we consider both full image and cropped image (forehead to nose). Object detection or Face detection using Haarcascade feature based cascade classifiers is an effective object detection method proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones. It is basically a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. Also, absolute value from face edge detection using SOBEL give us some clear data to match faces with datasets for higher accuracy. Experimental data show that our model performs well with test data precisely and recall respectively.
